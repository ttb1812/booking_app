flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/translations/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: gilroy
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_extrabold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_heavy.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_light_italic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_medium_italic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_regular_italic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy_semi_bold.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
